# Starcraft_PlayersRank_Prediction

This repository is for the assessment of the Evil Genius League Data Scientist Internship.
The goal of this assessment is to build a model to predict Starcraft player's rank using given dataset.

I created a document in which I summarized my work in every process from preprocessing to model evaluation.

My output file is below:
* output_document.pdf: pdf file where I summarized the outputs and interpretation;
* output_ducument.ipynb: original notebook for the pdf file;
* util_functions.py: To simplify the work process and the output document, I created a function/class and stored them here.
